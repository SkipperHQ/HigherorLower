# Higher or Lower
My first real attempt at finishing a Python project I started, still very basic but hoping this is a repository of many to come.

<p>Basic Higher or Lower with a 'Bot' that picks a number, you're then prompted to choose a number and it'll tell you if its choice is <b>higher</b> or <b>lower</b>


I hope you enjoy, let me know if you find any errors or something I could do better, I'm still very new to Python.
